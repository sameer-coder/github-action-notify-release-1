    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify release

```

## Usage

Configure this action in your workflows providing the inputs described below in order to get notified in `x` time after the repo has been updated but no release has happened.

### **Deprecated** `stale-days: 7`

**Optional** The time after which unreleased commits should be considered stale and should notify for a release. The value can be a number or a string.
Example: `1 minute`.
Default is `7` days.

### `commit-messages-lines: 1`
